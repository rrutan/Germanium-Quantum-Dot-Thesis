I am proud of my thesis because it summarized several months of my 
independent work in the Thin-Film Optoelectronics lab to synthesize and test new materials 
to be used in solar panels.  My thesis was approved by the head of the UC Santa Cruz department chair, 
my thesis advisor, and my lab advisor to fulfill my Bachelor of Science in Physics requirement.  
This work displays my independent decision-making, activity scheduling, and presentation of scientific material.
This work is the culmination of undergraduate coursework and displays 
the beginning of my journey to collect and analyze data.
